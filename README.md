# astrology-prediction-ai
AI-based astrology prediction system

**Project Description
**
This project is a web-based Astrology Prediction Website that collects user details through a frontend form and processes them using an automated workflow built with n8n. The workflow integrates an LLM API to generate astrology-based guidance and sends the prediction to the user via email.

The project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a real-world application: frontend development, automation workflow design, AI integration, and deployment using GitHub Pages.

Project Architecture Overview
Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
→ n8n Webhook (POST request)
